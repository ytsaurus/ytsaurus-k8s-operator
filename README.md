# ytsaurus-k8s-operator

YTsaurus is a distributed storage and processing platform for big data with support for MapReduce model, a distributed file system and a NoSQL key-value database.

This operator helps you to deploy YTsaurus using Kubernetes.

## Description
Currently available in alpha-version and is capable to deploy a new YTsaurus cluster from scratch, primarily for testing purposes. Also can perform automated cluster upgrades with downtime.


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

You can install pre-built versions of operator via [helm chart](https://hub.docker.com/r/ytsaurus/ytop-chart).

Next you need to [prepare the Ytsaurus specification](https://ytsaurus.tech/docs/en/admin-guide/prepare-spec), see provided [samples](config/samples) and [API Reference](docs/api.md).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/cluster_v1_demo.yaml
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/ytsaurus-k8s-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/ytsaurus-k8s-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
We are glad to welcome new contributors!

1. Please read the [contributor's guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. We can accept your work to YTsaurus after you have signed contributor's license agreement (aka CLA).
3. Please don't forget to add a note to your pull request, that you agree to the terms of the CLA.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
